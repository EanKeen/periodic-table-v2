# Periodic Table Version 2

Same project goals as Periodic Table Version 1. Rewritten because I've learned a lot since starting the first version.

## Roadmap (Short-Term)

- Make nav element have indented color when selected
- Fix whitespace in main periodic table (make it look nicer)
- Have highlighting of elements
  - Pass currently highlighted column to state and have a watcher that highlights all other atoms accordingly

## Roadmap (Long-Term)

- Run the theme files against program, checking their schema

### Notes

#### Atom font sizes
