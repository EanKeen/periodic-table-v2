# Periodic Table Version 2
Same project goals as Periodic Table Version 1. Rewritten because I've learned a lot since starting the first version.

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
